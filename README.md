# AbaloneMutationRate

This repo contains all code associated with:


T. B. Wooldridge, S. M. Ford, H. C. Conwell, J. Hyde, K. Harris, B. Shapiro, **Direct measurement of the mutation rate and its evolutionary consequences in a critically endangered mollusk**. Mol. Biol. Evol. 42, msae266 (2025).

I've uploaded the code in a series of jupyter notebooks that draw on python, R, bash, etc. These notebooks were run of an HPC configured with `slurm`, which is why you'll see a lot of references to `slurm` commands in my code.
